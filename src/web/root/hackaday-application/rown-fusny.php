<p>If you're old like me you might have developed an aversion to
<a href="https://hackaday.com/category/wireless-hacks/">wireless</a>
devices twenty or thirty years ago which might
now be in need of revision.</p>

<p>In the old days wireless devices were unreliable, had poor sound quality, low range, and terrible battery life. They used
insecure protocols, and were expensive. You were better off going with a wire cable you could trust. But times have changed.</p>

<p>These days, for less than $100, you can get a wireless headset that sounds great, has reliable connectivity, and lasts
for 12 hours on a single charge. The
<a href="https://rownfusny.com/">Rown Fusny</a>
R03U Wireless Mono Headset is one such device.</p>

<p>I recently did a review of the R03U and I was pleasantly surprised about a few things. When I got the device I was
expecting wireless
<a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/usb/">USB</a>
connectivity with a dongle, and it has that, but it has
<a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/bluetooth/">Bluetooth</a>
support as well.</p>

<p>Switching between USB and Bluetooth is as simple as tapping a button on the side of the headset. You can connect the USB
dongle to your computer and pair the headset with your phone via Bluetooth and then easily toggle between devices.</p>

<p>You might think that your wired headphones are just-fine-thank-you-very-much but you might be surprised how much
<em><strong>freer</strong></em> you feel when you're not tethered to your computer.</p>

<p>And if you need to retain situational awareness the R03U is a mono headset, so you have one ear free and can still hear
what's going on around you while you're listening to your music or taking a call.</p>
